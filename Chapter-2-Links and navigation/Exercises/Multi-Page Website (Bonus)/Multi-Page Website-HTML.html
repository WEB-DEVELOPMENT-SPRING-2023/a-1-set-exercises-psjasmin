            <p><mark>In the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece</mark>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, a shy
                young hobbit named
                Frodo Baggins inherits a simple gold ring. He knows the ring has power, but not that he alone holds the
                secret to the survival--or enslavement--of the entire world. Now Frodo, accompanied by a wizard, an elf,
                a dwarf, two men and three loyal hobbit friends, must become the greatest hero the world has ever known
                to save the land and the people he loves.

            <div class="qoute">
                <p>
                    <b>Frodo:</b> I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. <br><br>
                    <b>Gandalf:</b> So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to
                    decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world
                    Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also
                    meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.
